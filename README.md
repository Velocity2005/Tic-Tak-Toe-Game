# Tic-Tak-Toe-Game
Play against a Tic Tak Toe A.I. that uses the Minimax Algorithm to function

To actually play the game install all files into a folder and run the runner.py file along with the nessary libraries (python ide is required or at the very least python must be installed on your computer)

I personally recommend PyCharm for your endeavors
